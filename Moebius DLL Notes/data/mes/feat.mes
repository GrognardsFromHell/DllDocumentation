{5574} Defensive Roll {The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (non-magical), the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw. If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow. This only applies to non-sneak attacks. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogues evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.}

With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more than once per round.}

{5603}{Ki Strike}
{5604}{Sneak Attack}
{5605}{Trapfinding}
{5606} Crippling Strike {A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.}
{5607} Opportunist {Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogues attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat cant use the opportunist ability more than once per round.}
{5608} Skill Mastery {The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.}
{5609} Slippery Mind {This ability represents the rogues ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.}
